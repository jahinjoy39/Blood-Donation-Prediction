## 📊 Project Description

The objective of this project is to predict blood donation behavior using historical data of blood donors. It helps in identifying individuals likely to donate blood again, which is valuable for planning blood drives and managing donor outreach efficiently.

## 🧠 Dataset Information

The dataset has the following columns:

1. **Recency (months)** – months since last donation  
2. **Frequency (times)** – total number of donations  
3. **Monetary (cc blood)** – total blood donated  
4. **Time (months)** – months since first donation  
5. **Target (whether they donated in March 2007)** – 1 (Yes), 0 (No)
